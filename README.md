## Description

This Team Profile Generator showcases the JavaScript(Object-oriented programming), Test--driven development (Jest), Node.js and npm skills I have gained from Module 12 (Test-Driven Development) of the Front-end Web Development Bootcamp. 


## Usage & Installation

1. The **Team Profile Generator** can be installed by cloning the source files to your machine

2. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

3. Once opened in the command line, follow the prompts to answer questions about your team members (Manager, engineer or intern). When you are finished answering all the questions, the program will generate a team.html file to the /output directory.
